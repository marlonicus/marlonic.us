    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>For over 10 years Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of developing a variety of products, ranging from websites, mobile web-applications, to digital installations and mini-games, for an eclectic mix of clients, including: Volvo, Formula 1, H+M, Rolex, Diageo and more.</p>
    <p>I am at my strongest when working with JavaScript, especially when coupled with React, and have years of experience working on large scale JavaScript applications. For server-side functionality I will often reach for Node.js, and I take an interest in architecting and constructing CI/CD pipelines to help ship products.</p>
    <p>I am a keen advocate of continuous integration/delivery/deployment and the practices that come with it (early releases, automated testing, monitoring/metrics, feature toggles, etc..). I believe these are critical for any products ability to evolve quickly in a fast moving digital world.</p>
    <p>I enjoy working within agile autonomous teams and have recently been involved in a broad scale agile-transformation within a large organization. I was the tech lead in what would become an exemplar agile product team. By combining both agile and lean principles across every aspect of our work, with regular retrospectives and continuous improvement, we were able to build a team with an unparalleled cycle time; rapidly delivering business value through customer data driven user stories.</p>
